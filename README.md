# Plant App Documentation

This is a technical documentation for the Plant Photo App.
The app was created as a homework assignment for NOCFO.

## Setting the environment

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   https://github.com/GudokVlad-Pilot/PlantPhotoApp.git
   ```

2. Check that you have the latest Node.js version

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

3. If you do not have Node.js istalled, you can download it from here: [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en)

4. [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) is recommended to be installed on your mobile device to see the app.

When everything is done, you can run the app.

## Instructions to run the app

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Scan a QR code that will be displayed in the output with Expo Go to launch the app on your mobile device. While a web version is available from the output also, this task focuses on mobile devices since the assignment requires using the device's camera.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
